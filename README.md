Big Game Census Data Visualization

Project Overview:
This project is about creating a Big Game Census Data Visualization. The goal is to analyze and visualize census data related to big game populations and trends, providing clear insights for decision-making.

data source: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19TY7wupudAq6KdLvkD1mzsBBtKZmBDZx/view

Analysis and dashboard:
Data Collection and Preparation:
Cleaning and preprocessing of the data was done and the dataset was ready for analysis and visualization.
Data Analysis:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and key insights from the dataset.
Data Visualization:
Created visual and informative dashboards using power BI.


Initial insights:
File 1 and File 2 (2016 and 2017 Census Data):
Both contain population estimates for various cities and states in the United States.
Columns include geographic identifiers (GEOID), city names, Census counts (2010), and annual population estimates from 2010 to 2017.

File 3 (Big Game Census Data):
Contains data specific to wildlife population statistics, like species, counts, geographic distribution, and potentially additional indicators.
Next, I'll focus on cleaning and preparing the Big Game Census Data for further analysis by handling missing values, ensuring consistency in geographic distribution fields, and organizing species population trends. ​​

Key Insights:
New England has higher representation of players from Southern states, while Philadelphia has a more evenly distributed player base.
The average weight of players across both teams is approximately 243.88 lbs.
The majority of players are in the age range of 20-30 years.

Tools and Technologies:
Power BI: For creating the visualization and dashboard.
Esri ArcGIS: for the mapping player data.
